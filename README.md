# QuestFlow #
***FlowQuest*** is a gamified productivity web application that transforms everyday goals into RPG-style quests. Instead of managing boring to-do lists, users embark on a personal journey, creating quests, earning XP, leveling up, unlocking achievements, and climbing through ranks from E-Rank Rookie to S-Rank Master.

The app helps you enter and stay in the ***Flow State*** by turning focus and consistency into measurable progress. Whether it’s studying, fitness, career tasks, or daily habits, FlowQuest keeps you motivated by visualizing growth through levels, XP bars, streaks, and achievements — making productivity feel like a game you want to keep playing.
